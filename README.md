# Tournament Generator
 Information Systems Development Project 2020
 
 ***Version 1.0.0***
 
 This tournament generator produces play offs for competetions with 8, 16 and, 32 teams, respectivly. 
 
 ## Usage 
The design of the Tournament Generator is very intuitive, meaning new users should be able to master the process quickly. 

1. New Users begin on the Homepage where there is a 'start' button to begin. 
2. Users are redirected to a page where they can create their new tournament. They can decide between a game with 8, 16, or 32 teams. The tournament is then created. 
2.1. Users can create a team without a tournament.
2.2. Users can create a team for a specific tournament. 
2.3. Users can create teams faster with the auto fill in function. 
3. A tournament tree is then generated.
4. Users can enter the winners and losers of each stage.
